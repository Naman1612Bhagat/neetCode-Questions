# You are given an m x n 2-D integer array matrix and an integer target.

# Each row in matrix is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The first integer of every row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.
# Return true if target exists within matrix or false otherwise.

# Can you write a solution that runs in O(log(m * n)) time?
